      The University Management System is a comprehensive full-stack web application designed to centralize and automate academic and administrative operations within a university environment. The platform provides dedicated, role-based dashboards for administrators, teachers, and students, ensuring that each user interacts only with the features relevant to their responsibilities.

Administrators can manage the entire academic structure, including departments, courses, semesters, teachers, and students. Teachers are able to create and manage classrooms, assign students, upload course materials, create exams and assignments, and track student performance. Students can enroll in courses, view schedules, access shared resources, submit assignments, and monitor exam results through a clean and intuitive interface.

The system focuses heavily on security and scalability, implementing secure authentication, protected API routes, and full CRUD operations for all core entities. Performance is optimized using efficient data fetching strategies and caching, ensuring smooth interactions even as data grows.

Built using Next.js and TypeScript, with Prisma and PostgreSQL for data integrity and scalability, the application leverages modern frontend tools such as React Query, Redux Toolkit, Tailwind CSS, and Shadcn UI to deliver a responsive and maintainable user experience. Additional integrations like Cloudinary and Nodemailer enhance file handling and system communication.`,
